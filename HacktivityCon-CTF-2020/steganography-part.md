### Spy vs. Spy

> Challenge statement:

Solution:
1. after downloaded the image, i try to translate the morse code in the image, but it wasn't the flag.

2. after that i tried using 'zsteg, strings, and exiv2 or exiftool to get the flag, but couldn't find it.

3. Later i used 'stegsolve' to find the flag within the picture using image filter in stegsolve

```
terminal command: java -jar stegsolve.jar
```
